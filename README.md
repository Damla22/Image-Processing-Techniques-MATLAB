# Image-Processing-Techniques-MATLAB
This repository contains solutions to a series of image processing tasks using MATLAB. Below is a detailed explanation of the tasks and the corresponding code. 

Task 1: Otsu's Method for Image Binarization
In this task, we implement Otsu's method to find the optimal threshold for binarizing a grayscale image and apply histogram equalization. 

Task 2: Applying Various Filters
In this task, we create and apply different filter masks to a grayscale image and display the results.

Task 3: Applying 1D Filters Along Rows and Columns
In this task, we define a function to apply 1-dimensional filters and use it to filter the image along rows and columns.

Summary
This repository covers various image processing techniques including Otsu's method for image binarization, histogram equalization, application of different spatial filters, and the use of 1-dimensional filters along image rows and columns. The tasks are implemented in MATLAB and the corresponding code snippets are provided for each task.
